      <section class="content">
        <h2>Mughal Influence and Royal Kitchens</h2>
        <p>
          The Delhi, Lucknow, and Hyderabad Mughal emperors made biryani a
          royal food. The dum-pukht method of covering the pot with dough and
          cooking very slowly over a low flame became the hallmark of Mughal
          cuisine. It allowed the meat and rice to absorb spices and flavors,
          giving the dish depth and richness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Court cooks and imperial chefs standardized biryani recipes, and
          every Mughal court became known for its own variant. These early
          customs shaped how biryani in India evolved region by region.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Mughal influence is often highlighted, some believe rice and
          meat dishes existed in India much earlier. Ancient texts mention rice
          cooked with ghee, spices, and meat. This suggests Indian biryani may
          be a blend of local culinary ideas and Persian techniques, rather than
          a direct copy.
        </p>

        <h2>Evolution into Regional Variants</h2>
        <p>
          As biryani spread across the Indian subcontinent, it adapted to local
          ingredients, spices, and tastes. This created a rich fabric of
          regional biryani styles.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Lucknow, Awadhi biryani developed with delicate seasoning, mild
          spice usage, and signature dum technique, reflecting Nawabi elegance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Kolkata, biryani took a unique turn with potatoes, introduced
          during the exile period of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. Potato remains a
          defining signature of Kolkata biryani.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hyderabad created one of the most famous styles: partially cooked meat
          and rice are layered and cooked together. Hyderabadi biryani is known
          for bold spice, saffron aroma, and fried onions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the Malabar coast, biryani carries coconut, curry leaves, and
          coastal spice notes, reflecting Kerala's local food culture while
          preserving biryani's essence.
        </p>

        <h2>The Dum Cooking Tradition</h2>
        <p>
          At the heart of Indian biryani history is dum cooking. This sealed,
          slow-cook method lets rice, meat, and spices exchange flavor deeply.
          Dum not only preserves aroma but also creates signature richness,
          whether in Lucknowi or Hyderabadi biryani.
        </p>

        <h2>Biryani as a Cultural Symbol</h2>
        <p>
          Biryani is prepared in Indian homes for Eid, Diwali, weddings, and
          family celebrations. Preparing biryani often becomes an act of love
          and hospitality. It is also highly versatile: vegetarian versions like
          tahiri or vegetable biryani are equally popular.
        </p>

        <h2>Biryani Beyond Borders</h2>
        <p>
          Today, biryani is no longer limited to the Indian subcontinent. It has
          traveled with the diaspora to cities like London, Dubai, and New York.
          Biryani-focused restaurants and food-delivery platforms have made it
          one of the most ordered dishes globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its worldwide popularity comes from range: it can be simple and
          home-style or rich and royal. From a Hyderabad street corner to a fine
          dining table abroad, biryani remains inclusive and beloved.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: A Dish of History and Heart</h2>
        <p>
          The history of Indian biryani is more than food history. Its journey
          from aristocratic kitchens to everyday homes and international menus
          proves its enduring appeal. Biryani reminds us that great food carries
          flavor, heritage, and connection between people.
